# Brute-force-4-digit-netflix-pin-code-on-phone-with-flipper-zero-and-phone-safe

First of all, for brute force to work, you need the unleashed os or Xtreme firmware os on your flipper zero instead of the stock one.

Afterwards you have to download the file "Duckyscript for brute force the pin code netflix" and transfer it to the "Tools/Bad KB/" directory of the flipper zero.

Then connect your flipper zero to the phone by cable, open the netflix pin code window and finally launch the script in bad usb with the flipper zero.


For information : The technique has been tested and worked successfully, the servers will not ban you because of all your attempts.


You can see how I generated the duckyscript using the python file called "Brute force generator for netflix pin code(python)" that I made available.

It was nothing !
